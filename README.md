# CodeClauseInternship_Object_Detection_System
So, here I will detect an object by training the model and applying it in the real world.
In this I have used obeject detection using yolov5 with my own custom data which is written coco128.yaml.

The whole is been done in google colab 

I have used yolov5s.pt which is a light weight model for the object detection even can be used in  noramal CPU

also I have trained the model which is named best.pt which need install torch verion 2.0.0 of cuda version - 11.7 as specdified in the main.ipynb cause it might need the gpu power to be used
